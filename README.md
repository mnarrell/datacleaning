Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
=================================================
***

This repository contains the submission for the [Getting and Cleaning Data]("https://class.coursera.org/getdata-016") course project.

This R script depends on the [dplyr]("http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html") package and will be installed by [Packrat]("http://rstudio.github.io/packrat/"), a dependency management system for R.

The run_analysis.R script may be run:
    
    source("run_analysis.R")

This will download the source data set, perform the tidying operations as described in the Code Book, and produce the output as a CSV file (./output/merged.csv).

Please examine the Code Book and the comments in the R script for detailed information.
